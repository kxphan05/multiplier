Why is the MAS's exchange rate policy more effective than interest rate policy for Singapore?,"As a small and open economy, Singapore is a price-taker with a high dependence on imports and exports. Interest rate policy is ineffective due to perfect capital mobility (interest rate parity), while the exchange rate directly manages imported inflation and export competitiveness.",,9,10,10,"The answer is highly faithful to the provided ground truth, accurately explains why the MAS's exchange rate policy is more effective than interest rate policy for Singapore, and directly addresses the question. It correctly identifies Singapore as a small, open economy and explains the limitations of interest rate policy due to perfect capital mobility, as well as the benefits of exchange rate policy for managing imported inflation and export competitiveness."
"Explain how the ""Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG)"" acts as a supply-side policy in Singapore.","The PSG reduces the marginal cost of technology adoption for firms, shifting the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve to the right by increasing capital productivity and potential output (Yf).",,9,9,10,"The answer is highly faithful to the context and correct in its factual content. It accurately describes how the PSG reduces the marginal cost of technology adoption, which increases capital productivity and shifts the LRAS curve to the right. The explanation is directly relevant to the question about how the PSG acts as a supply-side policy in Singapore."
Discuss the impact of a global recession on Singapore’s Balance of Payments (BOP).,"A global recession reduces foreign income, leading to a fall in demand for Singapore's exports (X). This worsens the Current Account. However, if investors seek ""safe havens,"" the Capital and Financial Account might see inflows, partially offsetting the BOP deficit.",,9,9,10,"The answer accurately describes the impact of a global recession on Singapore’s Balance of Payments, noting the decline in exports and worsening of the Current Account, as well as the potential for inflows in the Capital and Financial Account due to Singapore being a safe haven. The explanation is clear, concise, and directly addresses the question."
Why does the Singapore government provide subsidies for the COVID-19 vaccine?,"Vaccination is a merit good with positive externalities in consumption (herd immunity). In a free market, individuals ignore external benefits, leading to under-consumption and deadweight loss. Subsidies shift MPB towards MSB to reach the social optimum (Qs).",,9,9,10,"The answer is highly faithful to the provided ground truth, accurately explains the economic rationale for subsidies in the context of COVID-19 vaccines, and directly addresses the question. It clearly identifies vaccination as a merit good with positive externalities, explains the market failure, and describes how subsidies can correct this."
"How does a high ""Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)"" in Singapore affect the multiplier size?","Singapore has a high MPS due to compulsory CPF savings. According to the formula k = 1/(MPS+MPT+MPM), a high MPS increases the denominator, resulting in a small multiplier effect (k), meaning fiscal stimulus has a limited impact on National Income.",,8,9,10,"The answer is faithful to the context, correct in its factual content, and directly relevant to the question. It accurately explains how a high MPS affects the multiplier size in Singapore, using the correct formula and reasoning. The explanation is clear and concise, making it easy for a student to understand the concept."
Is the demand for Singapore's electronics exports likely to be price elastic or inelastic?,"Highly price elastic (PED > 1) due to the availability of many international substitutes (e.g., from Taiwan or Korea). Thus, a slight increase in the exchange rate can lead to a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded, worsening export revenue.",,9,10,10,"The answer is highly faithful to the context, correct in its factual content, and directly relevant to the question. It accurately identifies the demand for Singapore's electronics exports as highly price elastic (PED > 1) due to the availability of international substitutes, and correctly explains the potential negative impact of a slight increase in the exchange rate on export revenue."
"Explain the ""Crowding Out Effect"" in the context of Singapore’s fiscal policy.","Crowding out is generally less significant in Singapore because the government finances spending through accumulated reserves rather than borrowing from the domestic loanable funds market, thus avoiding upward pressure on interest rates.",,9,10,10,"The answer is faithful to the context, correct in fact, and highly relevant. It accurately explains why the crowding out effect is less significant in Singapore due to its reliance on accumulated reserves rather than domestic borrowing, and it directly addresses the question."
"Why is ""Cyclical Unemployment"" a major concern for Singapore compared to ""Structural Unemployment""?","As an export-oriented economy, Singapore is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global trade cycle. While structural issues exist (skills mismatch), global downturns cause rapid shifts in AD, leading to significant cyclical unemployment.",,9,9,10,"The answer accurately identifies cyclical unemployment as a major concern for Singapore due to its export-oriented economy and vulnerability to global trade fluctuations. It correctly contrasts this with structural unemployment, noting that while skills mismatches exist, global downturns cause rapid shifts in aggregate demand, leading to significant cyclical unemployment. The answer is faithful to the ground truth, factually accurate, and directly relevant to the question."
"Evaluate the use of ""Carbon Taxes"" in Singapore to correct market failure.","A carbon tax internalizes the external cost of pollution (Negative Externality in Production). By setting a tax equal to the Marginal External Cost (MEC) at the social optimum, the MPC is shifted to the MSC, eliminating deadweight loss.",,8,9,9,"The answer accurately describes how a carbon tax internalizes the external cost of pollution and corrects market failure. It correctly identifies the purpose of the tax and its effect on marginal costs. The answer is relevant to the question about Singapore's use of carbon taxes. However, it could be improved by mentioning that Singapore's carbon tax is relatively low and that the government has also implemented other measures to reduce emissions."
"How does the ""Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)"" affect the domestic labor market?","SAFTA increases market access, boosting AD and demand for labor in export sectors. However, it may increase structural unemployment in sunset industries that cannot compete with cheaper Australian imports, necessitating retraining.",,8,9,10,"The answer is faithful to the context and correct in its factual content. It accurately describes how SAFTA affects the domestic labor market, including both positive and negative impacts. The answer is highly relevant to the question and provides a comprehensive overview of the effects."
