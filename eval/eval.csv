Why is the MAS's exchange rate policy more effective than interest rate policy for Singapore?,"As a small and open economy, Singapore is a price-taker with a high dependence on imports and exports. Interest rate policy is ineffective due to perfect capital mobility (interest rate parity), while the exchange rate directly manages imported inflation and export competitiveness.",Macro: Monetary Policy (Exchange Rate),Policy Choice
"Explain how the ""Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG)"" acts as a supply-side policy in Singapore.","The PSG reduces the marginal cost of technology adoption for firms, shifting the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve to the right by increasing capital productivity and potential output (Yf).",Macro: Supply-Side Policy,Intervention
Discuss the impact of a global recession on Singapore’s Balance of Payments (BOP).,"A global recession reduces foreign income, leading to a fall in demand for Singapore's exports (X). This worsens the Current Account. However, if investors seek ""safe havens,"" the Capital and Financial Account might see inflows, partially offsetting the BOP deficit.",Macro: External Sector,Synthesis
Why does the Singapore government provide subsidies for the COVID-19 vaccine?,"Vaccination is a merit good with positive externalities in consumption (herd immunity). In a free market, individuals ignore external benefits, leading to under-consumption and deadweight loss. Subsidies shift MPB towards MSB to reach the social optimum (Qs).",Micro: Market Failure (Externalities),Efficiency
"How does a high ""Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)"" in Singapore affect the multiplier size?","Singapore has a high MPS due to compulsory CPF savings. According to the formula k = 1/(MPS+MPT+MPM), a high MPS increases the denominator, resulting in a small multiplier effect (k), meaning fiscal stimulus has a limited impact on National Income.",Macro: Multiplier Effect,Quantitative
Is the demand for Singapore's electronics exports likely to be price elastic or inelastic?,"Highly price elastic (PED > 1) due to the availability of many international substitutes (e.g., from Taiwan or Korea). Thus, a slight increase in the exchange rate can lead to a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded, worsening export revenue. However, Singaporean electronics are often price inelastic because they occupy high-tech, specialized niches with few direct substitutes, making global buyers less sensitive to price changes. Furthermore, as an export-oriented economy focused on high-value manufacturing, Singapore’s reputation for precision and reliability creates a ""brand"" loyalty that outweighs minor price fluctuations.",Micro: Elasticities,Concept Application
"Explain the ""Crowding Out Effect"" in the context of Singapore’s fiscal policy.","Crowding out is generally less significant in Singapore because the government finances spending through accumulated reserves rather than borrowing from the domestic loanable funds market, thus avoiding upward pressure on interest rates.",Macro: Fiscal Policy,Nuance/Critical
"Why is ""Cyclical Unemployment"" a major concern for Singapore compared to ""Structural Unemployment""?","As an export-oriented economy, Singapore is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global trade cycle. While structural issues exist (skills mismatch), global downturns cause rapid shifts in AD, leading to significant cyclical unemployment.",Macro: Unemployment,Contextual Ranking
"Evaluate the use of ""Carbon Taxes"" in Singapore to correct market failure.","A carbon tax internalizes the external cost of pollution (Negative Externality in Production). By setting a tax equal to the Marginal External Cost (MEC) at the social optimum, the MPC is shifted to the MSC, eliminating deadweight loss.",Micro: Market Failure (Pollution),Policy Evaluation
"How does the ""Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)"" affect the domestic labor market?","SAFTA increases market access, boosting AD and demand for labor in export sectors. However, it may increase structural unemployment in sunset industries that cannot compete with cheaper Australian imports, necessitating retraining.",Macro: International Trade,Labor Market
